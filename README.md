# Bubble Game
This repository is a Bubble Game created by using html, css and javascript. This game basically consists of 1-10 numbered bubbles, and we need to click the bubble to match its number with respective hit goal before the timer runs out. This game has a score feature too. Overall, this project enhanced my skills in javascript development.
